Project Euler C++ Code
Craig Cahillane - May 11, 2017

This repo contains my solutions to Project Euler problems in C/C++ code.
Project Euler is found here: https://projecteuler.net/

A couple of notes:

-> Problem_65.cpp must be compiled with the following additional flags:

g++ -lgmpxx -lgmp Problem_65.cpp -o Problem_65

This is because I introduced the GMP library which allows coding up effectively unlimited sized numbers.
I.e. where the "int" type is limited to 16 bits, "long int" is 32 bits, and "long long int" is 64 bits, 
the "mpz_class" is limited only by your computer memory.

In order to use the GMP library, download it here: https://gmplib.org/
Unzip the folder and change to the new directory to build GMP.
Follow the instructions here for Unix based systems: https://gmplib.org/manual/Installing-GMP.html
Make sure to use the flag --enable-cxx when you run ./configure, this enables C++ support:  

./configure --enable-cxx
make
make check
sudo make install

Also be sure to compile with g++ and not gcc, this causes clang linker errors (facepalm)
Now you should be able to include the linking flags -lgmp -lgmpxx with g++
